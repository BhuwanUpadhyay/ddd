# Chapter - 1.1. Definitions

Evans’ Domain-Driven Design further defines a few common terms that are useful when describing and discussing DDD practices:

## Domain

> A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. 
>
> — Blue Book

## Model

> A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
>
> — Blue Book

## Ubiquitous Language

> A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
>
> — Blue Book

To describe the domain, developers, architects,domain experts \(someone with the knowledge and skills in a particular domain who will work closely with you as you develop the domain model to ensure that you fully understand the business model before trying to represent it in code\), and anyone else involved in a project have to speak the same language, this in DDD methodology is called Ubiquitous language.

## Context

> A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
>
> — Blue Book

## Bounded Context

> A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.

> — Blue Book
