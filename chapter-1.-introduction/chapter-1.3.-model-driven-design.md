# Chapter - 1.3. Model-Driven Design

Software design is the most important phase of the software development cycle. Thinking about how to structure code before you start writing it is critical. Changes and updates will inevitably arise. Good software design plans and makes allowances for added features, algorithm changes, and new integrations.

Designing software is an exercise in problem solving. It requires you break a task down into its component parts, deciding how youâ€™ll address each part and how all the components will assemble together to produce the desired functionality.
