# Think DDD: A book on real world example for domain-driven design

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

Initially introduced and made popular by programmer Eric Evans in his 2004 book, Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, domain-driven design is the expansion upon and application of the domain concept, as it applies to the development of software. It aims to ease the creation of complex applications by connecting the related pieces of the software into an ever-evolving model. Domain-Driven Design \(DDD\) focuses on three core principles:

* Focus on the core domain and domain logic.
* Base complex designs on models of the domain.
* Constantly collaborate with domain experts, in order to improve the application model and resolve any emerging domain-related issues.
