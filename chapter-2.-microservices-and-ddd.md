# Chapter - 2. Microservices and DDD

Microservices have a symbiotic relationship with domain-driven design \(DDD\)—a design approach where the business domain is carefully modeled in software and evolved over time, independently of the plumbing that makes the system work.

Domain-driven design \(DDD\), is an approach used to build systems that have a complex business domain. So you wouldn’t apply DDD to, say, infrastructure software or building routers, proxies, or caching layers, but instead to business software that solves real-world business problems. It’s a great technique for separating the way the business is modeled from the plumbing code that ties it all together. Separating these two in the software itself makes it easier to design, model, build, and evolve an implementation over time.
